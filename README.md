This directory contains the Trivial RPC (TRPC) implementation.

A Google Protocol Buffers installation is required to build this
library. Provide the location of the protocol buffers installation
to ./configure.

Building:

  ./configure [--with-protobuf-base=path_to_protobuf]
  make

The test_client and test_server examples in the test/ subdirectory
demonstrate how to create a service definition with protocol buffers
(hello.proto) and how to implement the server-side service
(hello_service.cc).
