TRPC is a simple RPC protocol based on 
<a href='http://code.google.com/apis/protocolbuffers/'>Google Protocol
Buffers</a>. TRPC is designed for bare-bones simplicity, and has a limited feature set:
</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Synchronous RPC</strong>.
Client calls block on server response. While the service definitions supported by Protocol Buffers allow an RPC system to implement asynchronous notification, TRPC does not use this facility.
</li>

<li><strong>Symmetric client and server functionality</strong>.
RPC clients and servers use the same underlying set of communication primitives. Only the implementation of the service running on top of TRPC differs on the client or server end.
</li>

<li><strong>Tight integration with Protocol Buffers</strong>.
In addition to supporting services defined by Google Protocol Buffers, the
underlying communication protocol for TRPC is implemented using protocol
buffers.  
</li>

<li><strong>C++ and Java implementation</strong>. TRPC was created to facilitate Java front-end usage of C++-native services that are not amenable to easy integration through the JNI interface. Currently C++ (client and server) and Java (client only) implementations of TRPC are available.
</li>

</ul>

<h3>Documentation</h3>

<p>
We regret the lack of documentation at this time. Please take a look at the simple `hello.proto' example service and its client and server implementations.
